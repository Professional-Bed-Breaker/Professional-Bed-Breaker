# Hello, and welcome to my GitHub portfolio. üëãüèº

## About Me
- I tend to make many side projects in my free time to boost my portfolio. This portfolio will focus on projects for a certain community. I have many projects that I've worked on before, so don't be surprised if I do a mass upload here.

- I have plans of making my own website to showcase my work and to delve deeper into web development using JavaScript, HTML, and the React framework, so stay tuned.

- This is not a main account. I may not be here as often as the main account I focus on.

- If you know who I am, please respect my privacy. I do not want my identity being spread without my consent.

- Currently boosting my skillset so that I can work as a full stack developer, both as a career and as a hobby. I have desires to develop my own apps with interest in making them cross platform for both Android and iOS devices.
